## [User Stories](#user-stories)

### A SHORT BRIEF

Sometimes we dream to have a companion who personally uplifts our moods? Well, that idea is what my app/website is all about â€“ a fun filled and inspiring corner of the interweb where sadness is shaken off, and happiness sought. By incorporating little-comedic touches here and there, loads of bright colors, plus a dose of positive energy, I intend to help the user smile away there clouding mood.

#### [USER VIEW](#user-view)

1.  As a person, I want to receive uplifting and galvanising colourings to help me shift my mood and attitude, so I can feel more fine and empowered during the day.

2.  As a consumer struggling with anxiety or depression, I need to get admission to a secure and supportive website wherein I can discover consolation and reassurance, so I can sense much less isolated.

3.  As a user seeking out a every day select-me-up, I want to discover a curated series of amusing and uplifting content material, along with wonderful affirmations so I can begin my day on a high word and experience extra energised and influenced.

## [Visual Design](#visual-design)

#### [FLOW CHART](#flow-chart)

This is a simple flow chart that outlines the orientation of the site and what way the user will navigate from section to section.

<img src="assets/images/positive affirmation colour wheel  flow chat.png" alt="Flow chart" width="500px"/>

#### [WIREFRAMES](#wireframes)

|                                           Desktop                                            |    Pages    |                                           Mobile                                            |

#### [FONT](#font)

I decided on the font Nunito for its mild, rounded corners, which I believe will create a experience of warmth and approachability upon arrival. By choosing a font with a softer side, I purpose to bring a sense of comfort and ease, making users feel extra comfortable as they navigate the website.

[Google Fonts - Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito?preview.text=Beyong&query=Nunito)

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/nunito-font-family.jpg" alt="Website Font" width="500px"/>

#### [ICONS](#icons)

The icons I used are from the [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) Icon library using the <<i>i</i>> tag. They are utalised in the footer.

- X / Twitter
- Instagram
- TikTok

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/social-links.png" alt="Site links" width="500px"/>

#### [COLOURS](#colours)

I utilised the colouration palette generator [coolors](https://coolors.co) to create a harmonious colour scheme for the site. I aimed to create a welcoming surroundings via restricting the palette to a few key colours, warding off overwhelming visual stimuli. To attain the deeper blue tone <code>#2A495F</code>, I integrated the usage of a transparent <code>rgba(3, 3, 3, 0.2)</code> to obtain the desired impact.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/new-btm-colours.png" alt="Website colours" width="500px"/>

#### [LOGO](#logo)

The logo was created with the help of [deep AI](https://deepai.org/machine-learning-model/text2img) image generator. I wanted the user to be greeted with a grounding picture as their first impression of of the site. The colour tones and tree give the calming grounding feeling I was looking for. My goal is to make the user have trust in the site, and I am confident that the logo will set that tone.

<img src="assets/images/btm-logo.webp" width='200px'>

## [Features](#features)

### Existing Features

#### [HOME PAGE](#home-page)

On the landing page I decided to greet the user with an upbeat message that explains what the app/ site will offer. I hope for the user to be feeling a little bit more positive and intrigued before they navigate to the application part of the site.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/home-page.png" alt="landing page" width="500px"/>

<br>

When they hover over the 'Lets Get Started' button it has an effect of lighting up. This is to give the impression of lighting the way for the user to follow. The navigation for the button is controlled by <code>addEventListener('click' function {})</code>

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/lgs-button.png" alt="Button to navigate to mood page" width="300px"/>

<br>

#### [COLOUR WHEEL AREA](#colour-wheel-area)

This is the colour wheel area of the <code>mood.html</code> page where the user is greeted with a small message asking them what mood is affecting their day.

<table "width=100%; table-layout: fixed;">
  <tr>
    <th style="width: 30%;">Image</th>
    <th style="width: 15%;">Feature</th>
    <th style="width: 55%;">Info</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="assets/images/readme-images/colour-wheel-area.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 250px;"/></td>
    <td>Wheel page</td>
    <td>The colour wheel area is set out with the mood buttons wheel section and the return message area.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="assets/images/readme-images/mood-selection.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 250px;"/></td>
    <td>Mood Selection</td>
    <td>The user picks from six different moods that can affect us all every day. Here we use <code>fetch('coloursAndFeelings.json')</code> to get the info from the JSON. The mood button corresponds to the same mood in the JSON.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="assets/images/readme-images/colour-wheel.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 250px;"/></td>
    <td>Colour Wheel</td>
    <td>After the user selects a mood, the wheel applies <code>applyColours(Object.values(coloursAndFeelings[mood]));</code> Each mood has 6 different colours.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="assets/images/readme-images/message-reply.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 250px;"/></td>
    <td>Message & colour display</td>
    <td>When the spin class finishes with the <code>setTimeout(() => {})</code> function, the user is presented with a message relating to the random colour. This is achieved with the <code>moodColourMsg()</code> function.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="assets/images/readme-images/onwards-button.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 250px;"/></td>
    <td>Onwards Button</td>
    <td>The onwards button takes the user to the affirmation section of the mood app. This is controlled with an <code>onwardsBtn.addEventListener('click', function () {})</code>. It also gives the user a feel of lighting the way, the same as the button on the home page.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### [AFFIRMATION & SCREENSHOT](#affirmation--screenshot)

This section is accessed through the Onwards Button where the mood container is replaced by container2. This is archived with

      mood.style.display = 'none';
      affirmation.style.display = 'flex';

within an <code>addEventListener('click', function () {});</code>.

This section also allow the user to take a screenshot of the affirmation and colour, so they can keep it with them.

<table "width=100%; table-layout: fixed;">
  <tr>
    <th style="width: 30%;">Image</th>
    <th style="width: 15%;">Feature</th>
    <th style="width: 55%;">Info</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="assets/images/readme-images/affirmaion-section.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 250px;"/></td>
    <td>Affirmation greeting</td>
    <td>The use is encouraged to click the button we use the <code>fetchAffirmation()</code> function to generate the card.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="assets/images/readme-images/screenshot-section.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 250px;"/></td>
    <td>Final card preview</td>
    <td>The user then receives their card with the quote, colour and positive word. They click the screen hot button which save there card to keep with them. This is achieved with the built in function <code> html2canvas</code>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="assets/images/readme-images/thank-you-message.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 250px;"/></td>
    <td>Thank you message</td>
    <td>After the user has taken the screenshot they are thanked for using the app. This is controlled with <code>affirmationBtn.addEventListener('click', function () {});</code> function. From there the user can return to the home screen.</td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="assets/images/readme-images/mood-card.jpg" style="width: 100%; max-width: 250px;"/></td>
    <td>Mood card screenshot</td>
    <td>This is an example of the screenshot card that is saved to the users download folder in either there mobile device or computer.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Other Features that I would like to Implement:

- <b>Idea 1:</b> I would like to add a feature that allows the user to share their card on social media. This would be a great way to spread the positivity and share the app with others.
  <br><br>
- <b>Idea 2:</b> One that allows the user to save their favourite cards to a gallery. This would be a great way for the user to keep track of their favourite cards.
  <br><br>
- <b>Idea 3:</b> Allow the user to keep track of their mood and affirmations. This would be a great way for the user to see how their mood has changed over time.

#### REFACTORING OF TWO FUNCTIONS

- My Original `handleMoodClick` Function:
```javascript
function handleMoodClick(button, colourWheel) {
  fetch('assets/json/coloursAndFeelings.json')
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((coloursAndFeelings) => {
      const mood = button.getAttribute('data-mood');
      localStorage.setItem('mood', mood);
      const message = document.getElementById('colourChoice');
      message.innerHTML = '';
      applyColours(Object.values(coloursAndFeelings[mood]));
      colourWheel.classList.add('spin');
      setTimeout(() => {
        const colorsKeys = Object.entries(coloursAndFeelings[mood]);
        const randomEntry = colorsKeys[Math.floor(Math.random() * 6)];
        const randomColourName = randomEntry[0];
        const randomColour = randomEntry[1];
        colourWheel.classList.remove('spin');
        colourWheel.style.background = randomColour.hex;
        localStorage.setItem('colourName', randomColourName);
        localStorage.setItem('colour', randomColour.hex);
        localStorage.setItem('feeling', randomColour.feeling);
        moodColourMsg();
      }, 3000);
    });
}
```
- CHANGES MADE TO THE FUNCTION
1. **`handleMoodClick`**: Fetches the JSON data and calls `processMoodClick` with the necessary parameters.
2. **`processMoodClick`**: Processes the mood click event by setting the mood, clearing any existing message, applying colors, and starting the color wheel spin.
3. **`clearMessage`**: Clears the message element's inner HTML.
4. **`spinColourWheel`**: Adds the spin class to the color wheel, and after 3 seconds, it stops the spin, selects a random color, saves the selected color, and displays the mood color message.
5. **`getRandomColour`**: Selects a random color from the mood colors.
6. **`saveSelectedColour`**: Saves the selected color's name, hex value, and associated feeling to local storage.

<br>

- My Original `fetchAffirmation` Function:
  ````javascript
  async function fetchAffirmation() {
  const quote = document.getElementById('quote');
  const author = document.getElementById('author');
  // Get the colour and mood from local storage
  const colour = localStorage.getItem('colour');
  const feeling = localStorage.getItem('feeling');
  // Get the selected colour and mood elements from the DOM
  const selectedColour = document.getElementById('selectedColour');
  const selectedFeeling = document.getElementById('selectedFeeling');
  // Get the card and line area elements from the DOM
  const card = document.getElementById('innerCard');
  const lineArea = document.getElementById('lineArea');

  // Set the colour of the card to the random colour
  card.style.backgroundColor = colour;
  lineArea.style.backgroundColor = colour;

  // Display the selected mood and colour on the card
  selectedColour.innerHTML = `Colour Code: ${colour}`;
  selectedFeeling.innerHTML = `Positive Word: ${feeling}`;

  let result;
  // Fetch the affirmation from the API
  try {
    // Get the URL for the selected mood
    const url = getQuotesByMood(localStorage.getItem('mood'));
    const response = await fetch(url, options);

    if (!response.ok) {
      debugger;
      // If the response is not ok, throw an error with the status
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    } else {
      // Parse the response into a JavaScript object and store it in the result variable
      result = await response.json();
      // Display the affirmation and author to DOM
      quote.innerHTML = result[0].quote;
      author.innerHTML = result[0].author;
    }
  } catch (error) {
    // Backup affirmations in case the API fails
    fetch('assets/json/backupQuotes.json')
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((backupQuotes) => {
        console.log(backupQuotes);
        // Display the affirmation and author to the console
        console.error(`Failed to fetch affirmation: ${error.message}`);
        // Backup affirmations in case the API fails
        const result =
          backupQuotes[Math.floor(Math.random() * backupQuotes.length)];
        // Display the affirmation and author to DOM
        quote.innerHTML = result.quote;
        author.innerHTML = result.author;
      });
  }

  // Change button text to 'Screenshot' & h1 text to 'Screen Shot Your Card'
  const affirmationBtn = document.getElementById('affirmationBtn');
  const cardH1 = document.getElementById('cardH1');
  affirmationBtn.innerHTML = 'Screenshot';
  cardH1.innerHTML = 'Screen Shot Your Card';

  // Add event listener to the button
  affirmationBtn.addEventListener('click', function () {
    const card = document.getElementById('card');
    html2canvas(card).then((canvas) => {
      // Convert the canvas to a data URL
      const imgData = canvas.toDataURL('image/jpg');

      // Create a link element
      const link = document.createElement('a');
      link.href = imgData;
      link.download = 'mood-card.jpg';

      // Download the image
      link.click();
    });
    // Hide the card and display the final container
    const container2 = document.getElementById('container2');
    const container3 = document.getElementById('container3');
    container2.style.display = 'none';
    container3.style.display = 'flex';
  });
  }
  ````
- CHANGES MADE TO THE FUNCTION
1. **Separation of Concerns**: The main function `fetchAffirmation` now delegates specific tasks to smaller functions, each responsible for one aspect of the operation.
   - `setCardColors`: Sets the background color of the card and line area.
   - `displaySelectedMoodAndColor`: Displays the selected mood and color on the card.
   - `handleApiResponse`: Handles the API response and updates the DOM.
   - `fetchBackupAffirmation`: Fetches affirmation from a backup JSON file if the API call fails.
   - `updateButtonAndHeader`: Updates the button and header text.
   - `addScreenshotListener`: Adds an event listener to the screenshot button.

2. **Error Handling**: The `try...catch` block in `fetchAffirmation` handles errors gracefully, using `fetchBackupAffirmation` if the API request fails.


#### OVERALL BENEFITS OF REFACTORING

  By breaking down the original TWO BIG FUNCTIONS into smaller helper functions, I achieve a more readability, maintainability, and reusable code. The refactored code is easier to understand and debug, and it follows the single responsibility principle, with each function handling a specific task.


  
- [WebAIM](https://wave.webaim.org/) - [Results](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://jamesmudidi.github.io/positive-affirmation-colour-wheel/) - No errors or warnings to show.
